  When you are finished with this assignment, text me (314-780-0489) &amp; we will go over it together. <strong>You cannot submit this assignment otherwise.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This assignment introduces the following elements, which you will add to two different webpages: <code>index.html</code> &amp; <code>custom-services.html</code>, which is new. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment. Note that you will not use every element on both pages!
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element doesn&rsquo;t change anything visually, so I&rsquo;m going to tell you where you will place it <i>on both pages</i>. <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> goes above the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element, while <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code> goes above the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, which you will see in the following PDFs.
</p>

<!-- index-3.html -->
<h2 style="font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace; color: #d01a19;">index.html</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment you are adding more to the <code>index.html</code> page. Again, do not change the name of the file&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it is still going to be <code>index.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Reproduce this webpage: <a href="https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev-assignments/herbert-west-landscaping/index-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>index-3.pdf</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  I don&rsquo;t need to give you text because it&rsquo;s the same as last week. You&rsquo;re just adding &amp; changing some HTML.
</p>

<!-- custom-services-1.html -->
<h2 style="font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace; color: #d01a19;">custom-services.html</h2>
<p>
  <code>index.html</code> lives directly inside the <code>herbert-west-landscaping</code> folder; in other words, we would say that <code>index.html</code> is inside the <i>root</i> of the Herbert West Landscaping project. However, <code>custom-services.html</code> does <em>not</em> go into the root folder; instead, it will go inside the <code>services</code> folder.
</p>
<p>
  To do that, you need to create a new folder inside the <code>herbert-west-landscaping</code> project named <code>services</code>; inside <code>services</code> you will create a new file named <code>custom-services.html</code> by using the <code>HTML.html</code> template. The result should look like this:

</p>
<p>
  The text you need is found in <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev-assignments/herbert-west-landscaping/custom-services-1.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-services-1.txt</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Reproduce this webpage: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev-assignments/herbert-west-landscaping/custom-services-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-services-1.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is <code>Custom Services :: Herbert West Landscaping</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the unordered list at the top of the page, &amp; everything from the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> down on this page, is exactly the same as that on <code>index.html</code>, so you can just copy &amp; paste that code.
