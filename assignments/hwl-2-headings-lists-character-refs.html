<!-- index-2.html -->
<h2 style="font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace; color: #d01a19;">index.html</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment you are adding more to the <code>index.html</code> page. Even though I reference <code>index-2.pdf</code>, your webpage will still be named <code>index.html</code>.<span style="color: red; font-size: 1.4em;">*</span>
</p>
<p>
  Reproduce this webpage: <a href="https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev-assignments/herbert-west-landscaping/index-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>index-2.pdf</code></a>
</p>
<p>
  Note that I added one sentence near the bottom, which you can copy from <code><a href="https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev-assignments/herbert-west-landscaping/index-2.txt">index-2.txt</a></code>. That is the only change to the text. Other than that, you&rsquo;re just changing some HTML.

<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>
  This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Character reference</h3>
<p>
  That new sentence you added has a problematic character at the beginning of it: <code>&lt;</code>. You might notice that once you put <code>&lt;</code> into Visual Studio Code, things look weird when you press Save. Why? A less-than character (<code>&lt;</code>) confuses Visual Studio Code because it thinks you&rsquo;re starting an HTML tag that doesn&rsquo;t really exist. The way to fix this problem is by changing the less-than symbol into a character reference, so don't forget to do that.

<p>
  <span style="color: red; font-size: 1.4em;">*</span> In the real world, you create a page&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;named <code>foo.html</code> for instance&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;&amp; you keep altering it as needed. You change stuff, remove some old stuff, add new stuff, &amp; so on. However, you keep the file&rsquo;s name &amp; do not change it, so every time you make a change, it would still be <code>foo.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
  What you do <strong>not</strong> do is increment the name of the file, from <code>foo.html</code> to <code>foo-1.html</code> to <code>foo-2.html</code>. Doing that would break links on your own site &amp; around the Web where people have linked to your webpage. So even though I refer to a file named <code>index-2.pdf</code> above, that <strong>does not mean</strong> that you should rename the file you are working on to <code>index-2.html</code>. Do <strong>not</strong> do that. Just leave it as <code>index.html</code> &amp; make the necessary changes.
