      <h2>See what our <s>prey</s> clients have to say</h2>

      <h3>The Lambert Family</h3>
      <p>
        “<b>It looks even better than we imagined.</b> You did everything that you stated you would do, when you stated you would do it, and went further and further to ensure the job was perfect. I am very grateful for your honesty, integrity, and skills. And that the wild Shoggoths only ate one of our dogs.”
      </p>

      <h3>The Torrance Family</h3>
      <p>
        “<b>We couldn't be any more pleased</b> with the appearance and workmanship of the job you completed for us. It’s so shiny and professional that it reminds us of this hotel we once stayed at. In fact, we have this great idea for a maze that we’d like to build, but with tentacles…”
      </p>

      <h3>The Oswalt Family</h3>
      <p>
        “<b>Amazing job! Our yard was covered</b> in Poison Ivy, Nightshade, and other poisonous and/or deadly plants, and now it’s safe enough to hold our weekly baby fights out there! Everyone is much happier—we haven’t lost a baby to a baby-eating plant for <em>weeks</em> now! We can even hang out in a tree, or have a BBQ, or have a pool party.”
