I see you've typed "i" and have the `site-overview.html` file open. Let me take a look at the current content of this file to understand what you might want to do with it.

Read file: assignments/site-overview.html

I can see that the `site-overview.html` file currently contains just a brief introduction about building a website for Herbert West Landscaping, but it's incomplete. The file mentions "A section overview" but doesn't actually provide the overview.

Could you clarify what you'd like me to do? Are you looking to:

1. Complete the site overview by adding the actual sections and structure?
2. Edit something specific in this file?
3. Something else entirely?

If you'd like me to complete the site overview, I can analyze the project structure and create a comprehensive overview of all the sections and pages that will be built for the Herbert West Landscaping website.

Please replace all instances of ` around words with <code> & </code>

I'll help you replace all instances of backticks (`) around words with `<code>` and `</code>` tags in the `site-overview.html` file. Let me first read the entire file to see all the instances that need to be replaced.

Now I can see all the instances where backticks are used around words. I'll replace them with `<code>` and `</code>` tags. I can see several instances throughout the file that need to be updated.

Perfect! I've successfully replaced all instances of backticks (`) around words with `<code>` and `</code>` tags throughout the `site-overview.html` file. The changes include:

1. **Folder names**: `herbert-west-landscaping`, `about`, `contact`, `products`, `projects`, `services`, `tips`
2. **File names**: `index.html`, `fertilizers.html`, `pesticides.html`, `seed.html`
3. **File paths**: All the file paths in the list at the bottom of the document

All the backtick-wrapped text has been converted to proper HTML `<code>` tags, which will render the text in a monospace font and indicate that these are code/file names.
