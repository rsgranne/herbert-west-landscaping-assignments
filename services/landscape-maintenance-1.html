      <h1>We Fit Your <em>Exact</em> Needs</h1>

      <h2>We are <em>super</em> helpful!</h2>

      <p>
        Beautiful quality is our promise. We promise to all of our clients not only a completed beautiful project, but one of exceptional beauty and quality. We understand the importance of one’s beautiful home and business, and we pride ourselves in working with you to create and maintain these beautiful areas, so you can spend more time enjoying your beautiful space. We stand behind our beautiful work, offering a beautiful 3-year warranty on all of our beautiful jobs, and are proud to say that we’ve never had a warranty claimed. We believe this is a result of our superior attention to beautiful detail, our commitment to doing the beautiful job right the first beautiful time, and the fact that people that have said they were going to claim a warranty have all disappeared mysteriously. Beautiful!

      <h3>Weekly Lawn Service</h3>

      <p>
        Did you know that grass can grow anywhere from 2-6 inches a week (depending on temperature, humidity, time of year, and chicken sacrifices) which is why we provide weekly lawn service. We come out and cut your lawn once a week, on the day of your choice, as long as it is Tuesday. And we bring the chickens!
      </p>

      <h3>Edging</h3>

      <p>
        It’s the finishing touch of mowing, kind of like getting a shave after you’ve had a haircut by a guy named Kevin, who likes to talk talk talk about how great weightlifting is and how he likes to lift weights and you should lift weights too and you’re just there to get a trim on your hair and instead you have to listen to this really muscular guy drone on about how great he feels because he and his wife and other buddies like to lift weights like every single damn day of the week. It’s just like that, but without Kevin. An <i>edger</i> is used to trim the lawn along a hard surface like a driveway or sidewalk. They cut a nice clean edge. Real clean edge, real nice, reaaallll nice. This is included with our lawn service. The edging. Not Kevin.

      <h3>Fertilizer & Weed Control</h3>

      <p>
        Lawn weeds such as crabgrass and dandelions and <i>Terribilis vinea</i> pose one of the most persistent and annoying challenges in the great Canadian quest to grow decent grass. The fertilizer we apply to your lawn is a combination of both fertilizer and weed control, and also a combination of our goats and Steve working together after a Taco Bell run. It smells pretty awful for a few days, but hey, after that you get a beautiful, thick, green lawn. One word of advice, though—if you look outside a week or so later and see Steve, we advise you to open your door and say, “Now just run on, Steve! You’re done here! That’s it—move along now!”
      </p>

      <h3>Sod</h3>

      <p>
        To start new lawns, or even repair damaged lawns, many people wonder which is better—laying sod or sowing grass seed. Seeding sure is cheaper and it offers a wider variety of grass types, but many people are won over by sod. They say, “Sod, you sure are nice. You have won me over.” Laying sod is fast and produces high-quality new lawns. In fact, laying sod is so fast, it’s fair to say it gives you an “instant lawn”. This can be very important if you’re trying to hide the bodies. But don’t worry—we are nothing if not discreet. Especially after a little monero slides across our palms, if you get our drift.

      <h3>Dog <s>Shi</s> Waste Removal</h3>

      <p>
        We come to your home and comb through your property for any dog waste or pet waste, unless it’s from a Medusa or Chimera. We want nothin’ to do with those. Since stools are usually solid (and if they’re not, you know, just don’t call us), owners have the option of frequent manual removal. Just give us one of your salad forks, and away we will go. With less time for nitrogen waste to dissolve into the lawn, poo-poo that is frequently removed damage lawns less than pee-pee. <strong>Note: we do not remove human waste.</strong> Sorry Earl.
      </p>

      <h3>Mulch</h3>

      <p>
        <i>Mulch</i> is any type of material that is spread or laid over the surface of the soil as a covering. Yes, this includes blood. But not Nessus blood, because that stuff burns! It is used to retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool and make the garden bed look more attractive. Oh, and if it’s blood, it will scare the living hell out of the neighbor children (unless it was their blood, in which case, it won’t). Wood chips are an extremely popular mulch because of its neat appearance, as well as its hardiness and the easy ability to set your lawn on fire when your nosy neighbor Karen wanders into your yard again. We carry mulch in these colors:
