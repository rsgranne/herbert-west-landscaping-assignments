<p>Back in 2006 a group of developers created Sass, which then became SCSS soon after. <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> (pronounced Sass, which is confusing, I know) is a language that ultimately converts into CSS. It makes a lot of things that are difficult or time-consuming in CSS much easier to specify, so that the tedium of some CSS creation goes away. However, the W3C noticed how popular SCSS was getting, so it decided to take some of its best ideas and roll those into CSS. Today we are learning about the results in one very important area: CSS custom properties. They are <em>great</em>, and I think you will see why very quickly.</p>
