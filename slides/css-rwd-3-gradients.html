  Today we start rebuilding the Herbert West Landscaping website using Bootstrap. We are going to work our way from the top of the homepage down to the bottom, which means we are going to start first with the navigation bar at the top. As part of building that, we will need to learn about CSS gradients. This is useful, interesting, and fun.
