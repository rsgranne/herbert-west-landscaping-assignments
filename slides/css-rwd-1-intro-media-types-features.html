<p>Itâ€™s time to learn responsive web design! Everything we have covered so far will play a part in understanding the methodology, technology, &amp; code that we will be using. To start this next phase, we will learn about <code>@media</code>, the CSS <i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule">at-rule</a></i> that make responsive design possible at all, &amp; then look at the different historical layout methods that finally brought us to responsive design.</p>
<p>In these slides, read <strong>from the beginning through the section titled <i>Responsive Layouts</i></strong>.
