<h2>Canvas Information</h2>
<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a> is where course content, grades, and communication will reside for this course.</p>
<p>If you ever need help, click on the Get Help button on the far left of these Canvas webpages.</p>
<h3>Texts &amp; Other Expenses</h3>
<p>There are no required books. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ Readings &amp; course materials will consist of slides, webpages, &amp; assignments I have created or that I will provide to you. Virtually everything you need can be accessed via Canvas. When it&rsquo;s appropriate I may recommend books useful for further study &amp; reference.</p>
<h3>Technical Needs &amp; Skills</h3>
<p>You need to use a laptop or desktop computer that runs a modern version of macOS, Windows, or Linux. I love my iPad, but tablets just aren&rsquo;t there yet when it comes to Web development, so please don&rsquo;t try to use one. Chromebooks are not great either.</p>
<p>Your computer needs to have a modern web browser installed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a Chromium-based browser; this includes Chrome &amp; the new Edge (pre-installed on newer releases of Windows), but I would recommend giving <a class="external" href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brave</a> a try&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s just like Chrome &amp; Edge, but <a class="external" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/study-ranks-edges-default-privacy-settings-the-lowest-of-all-major-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without the corporate surveillance &amp; data mining</a> (supposedly Canvas works best in a Chromium-based browser, but if you like Firefox or Safari, try those &amp; let me know)</li>
  <li><a class="external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a></li>
  <li>Safari comes pre-installed on all Macs</li>
  <li>You <em>do not</em> need Lockdown browser, because I would never require you to use that insecure thing</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to install some free software, but I will walk you through that when it happens.</p>
<p>As far as technical skills, you should know how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use your file manager (Finder on macOS &amp; File Explorer on Windows) to create files &amp; folders as well as copy &amp; paste files &amp; folders; in addition, you should understand how a folder structure works (files go in folders, which go in other folders, which go in other folders, &amp; so on)</li>
  <li>understand how to search for files, folders, &amp; programs on your computer</li>
  <li>install software</li>
  <li>use a Web browser</li>
  <li>zip (<em>compress</em> or <em>archive</em>) &amp; unzip (<em>unarchive</em>) files &amp; folders</li>
  <li>work with multiple programs, &amp; multiple windows, open at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal skills that are always good to have, but especially in this course, are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the ability to listen &amp; pay attention</li>
  <li>a detail-oriented mindset</li>
  <li>feeling OK about asking questions &amp; admitting you don&rsquo;t know something</li>
  <li>a willingness to learn, practice, &amp; then use <i>key commands</i> (also known as <i>keyboard shortcuts</i>) like <code>âŒ˜S</code> on macOS &amp; <code>Ctrl+S</code> on Windows to Save, &amp; other things that will make you more productive</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your grade will be based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attendance (15%)</strong>: This is a very intensive, hands-on course, and we will cover a lot of material, so it is imperative that you are in class. If you miss classes, you <em>will</em> fall behind, &amp; we will need to talk about your grade.</li>
  <li><strong>Online Discussions (5%)</strong>: There may be some online discussion questions that you will need to answer. Please note that to get full points on a discussion question, <em>you need to provide an answer to my prompt &amp; also respond to another student</em>. Failure to do one of those means you will lose 50% of the grade for that discussion question.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignments for Herbert West Landscaping (70%)</strong>: You will create a website for a spooky Canadian lawn care company throughout the course, progressing from simple &amp; ugly to responsive &amp; attractive. Almost all of the work you will do in this course will be on that website, spread out over many assignments.</li>
  <li><strong>Quizzes (10%)</strong>: You will have regular quizzes about the materials you have read; however, you may&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;& should!&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;use any of the class materials while answering them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are allowed (nay, encouraged!) to use your class notes, my slides &amp; videos, websites, &amp; any other resources you can access for any work in course. However, <strong>do not plagiarize</strong>. See below for my policies on using AI tools like ChatGPT in this course.</p>
<p>Grades will be based on an average of the above as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 90-100%</li>
  <li>B 80-89%</li>
  <li>C 70-79%</li>
  <li>D 60-69%</li>
  <li>F 0â€“59%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructional Goals</strong>: This class will provide an environment where the College&rsquo;s goals for students in the areas of Critical Thinking, Writing Across the Curriculum, and Computer Literacy are practiced. These will be utilized in a variety of ways throughout the course.</p>
<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>HOMEWORK</strong>: I am not a stickler for due dates &amp; times, because I know that life happens. However, <em>do not fall behind</em> with your homework. There are a lot of assignments in this course, and each one builds on the previous one, so you should not work on assignment D unless I have already graded assignments A through C. If you need an extension, just let me know &amp; I will be cool with it. However, falling further &amp; further behind will eventually be very problematic for both you &amp; me, &amp; will eventually reduce your grade on individual assignments.</p>
<p>Please note that I will <em>not</em> grade code by myself. Instead, <strong>I will grade all code with you</strong>. We can meet in person or we can meet over Zoom at a convenient time for you. Most of the time these will be very quick meetings. You will also know immediately what your grade is and what you need to do to improve.</p>
<p><strong>AI</strong>: I cannot stop you from using ChatGPT &amp; other generative AI tools, but since I will be grading all assignments with you, you can expect that I will quiz you about your code, <em>especially</em> if I suspect you are using AI tools &amp; just copying &amp; pasting without really understanding the code. The more you use AI tools to generate your code, the less you will understand, &amp; while that may get you a decent grade in this course, it will <strong>spell your doom</strong> when you go into an interview &amp; cannot answer even basic questions because you never learned how to code &amp; only learned how to query an AI &amp; then paste the answer it gave you. You may use AI to help you, but do not rely on it!</p>
<p><strong>GRADING</strong>: Assignments will be graded as soon as we meet. It is up to you to contact me &amp; propose a date &amp; time for us to meet.</p>
<p><strong>WELCOME MODULE</strong>: Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the information contained in the Welcome Module of this course. Please begin this course by logging into Canvas and navigating through that Module.</p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL</strong>: A student may be referred for an administrative withdrawal for excessive absences or lack of work turned in during the class. Students should not assume they will be withdrawn&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it remains their responsibility to withdraw from any class they do not plan to attend. For specific details on the policy, refer to the <a class="inline_disabled external" href="http://www.stchas.edu/academics/student-resources/student-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCC Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ACE CENTER</strong>: If you need academic assistance in this course, I will happily meet with you, but you may also wish to go to the ACE Center. The ACE Center is now located in the LRC on the first floor.</p>

<p>This is a tentative schedule and is subject to change.</p>
