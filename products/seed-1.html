      <h1>Our Special Seeds Will Make You a New Person</h1>

      <h2>Plant them in a flower pot & set it by your bed.</h2>
      <p>
        We consider our seeds to be a vitally important part of our work. In fact, we are so confident that our seeds will help you become a new, better person that we give them away for free. Take as many as you like, put them in small pots, & then spread them throughout your house. Nightstands in bedrooms and small tables by couches are particularly good places that we recommend. Any places people sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a good night’s sleep next to our seeds, you’ll wake up the next day feeling brand new, almost like a different person entirely. Clean up any powdery residue that you find, and go forth and spread the wonders of our seeds to your friends and family and anyone else that you know. We know you’ll be a happy member of our special seed-lovers family very soon!

      Our salesmen have been hard at work since the 1950s. Back then, the seeds were a bit larger.

    <h3>Distributing seeds far & wide since 1956</h3>
